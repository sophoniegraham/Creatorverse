## Notes 📝

Some challenges I faced while building this app:
- Setting up Supabase RLS policies correctly to allow API reads/writes
- Fixing "failed to fetch" errors due to table name mismatches
- Managing React Router routes for viewing and editing creators
- Styling cards and layout to look clean and modern

Overall, this project helped me strengthen my React CRUD + Supabase integration skills.
